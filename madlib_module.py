    This is a command line game that similates a Madlib game.  It prompts the user
    for a series of words to fit each required component of a Madlib template.  The

    the Madlib is displayed to the user on the command line.  It is also written to an
    output file.

    This program utilizes Pythonâ€™s built in capabilities for reading and writing files 
    and the regex module that will be used to do pattern string search and replacement.
