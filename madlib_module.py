    This is a command line game that similates a Madlib game.  It prompts the user
    for a series of words to fit each required component of a Madlib template.  The
    user input responses will be used to populate the template in the proper position.
    The Madlib is displayed to the user on the command line.  It is also written to an
    output file.

    This program utilizes Pythonâ€™s built in capabilities for reading and writing files 
    and the regex module that will be used to do pattern string search and replacement.
